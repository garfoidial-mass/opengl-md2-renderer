# opengl-md2-renderer

This is a quake 2 model renderer that I wrote to learn opengl. As it was a learning project, it can probably be improved and optimized a ton, and if you for some reason
end up using this code, I recommend you try.

Dependencies: requires glm, glew and glfw3, along with some header files from the common folder found here: https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl.
It also requires opengl32.lib and glu32.lib to be linked. I compiled this using visual studio 2019.

If you want to understand the md2 file format, look here: http://tfc.duke.free.fr/coding/md2-specs-en.html

This is the set of tutorials I followed to start learning opengl (they're really good): http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/

Good luck with whatever you're doing!
